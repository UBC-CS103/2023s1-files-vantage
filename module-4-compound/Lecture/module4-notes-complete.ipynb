    "- Office hours are an opportunity for you to talk with me or a TA and ask any questions that you have. Feel free to attend even if you don't have specific questions; you can sit and work and ask a question when something comes up. The summer term goes by quickly and attending office hours is a great way to keep on top of the course material.\n",
    "- If you lost any marks on a tutorial, we give you an opportunity to resubmit and earn back up to half the marks. The first tutorial resubmission is due on Sunday, May 28 at 10pm. I open them after the tutorials are graded and they will be due at least 48 hours later. I will announce each one on Piazza when it opens. See the canvas assignment for details - there's a specific format that you must follow.\n",
    "- Tutorial attendance is not graded but is **highly** recommended. It's an opportunity to work on your tutorials with TAs available to help you.\n",
    "- Our midterm is scheduled for June 6 from 5-6:30pm in the ICCS building. If you have a confict with that time, you must fill out the survey (posted on Piazza) by Friday, May 26 at 11am"
